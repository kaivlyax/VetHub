    symptoms: [
      "Chest pain when breathing or coughing",
      "Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)",
      "Cough, which may produce phlegm",
      "Fatigue",
      "Fever, sweating and shaking chills",
      "Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems)",
      "Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea",
      "Shortness of breath"
    ],
    treatment: "Treatment involves antibiotics and respiratory support. For bacterial pneumonia, antibiotics are prescribed. For viral pneumonia, antiviral medications may be used. Rest, fluids, and fever-reducing medications are also recommended. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary for oxygen therapy."
  },
  "Tuberculosis": {
    symptoms: [
      "Coughing that lasts three or more weeks",
      "Coughing up blood",
      "Chest pain, or pain with breathing or coughing",
      "Unintentional weight loss",
      "Fatigue",
      "Fever",
      "Night sweats",
      "Chills",
      "Loss of appetite"
    ],
    treatment: "Treatment usually involves taking antibiotics for at least six to nine months. The exact drugs and length of treatment depend on age, overall health, possible drug resistance, the form of TB (latent or active) and the infection's location in the body."
  },
  "COVID-19": {
    symptoms: [
      "Fever or chills",
      "Cough",
      "Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing",
      "Fatigue",
      "Muscle or body aches",
      "Headache",
      "New loss of taste or smell",
      "Sore throat",
      "Congestion or runny nose",
      "Nausea or vomiting",
      "Diarrhea"
    ],
    treatment: "Treatment depends on severity. Mild cases may require rest, fluids, and over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms. More severe cases may need antiviral medications, supplemental oxygen, or other interventions. COVID-19 vaccines are available to prevent severe illness."
  },
  "Skin Cancer": {
    symptoms: [
      "A new, unusual growth or a change in an existing mole",
      "A sore that doesn't heal",
      "Spread of pigment from the border of a spot into surrounding skin",
      "Redness or a new swelling beyond the border of the mole",
      "Change in sensation, such as itchiness, tenderness, or pain",
      "Change in the surface of a mole â€“ scaliness, oozing, bleeding, or the appearance of a lump or bump"
    ],
    treatment: "Treatment depends on the type, size, and stage of cancer. Options include surgical removal, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. Regular skin checks and sun protection are important preventive measures."
  },
  "Cataracts": {
    symptoms: [
      "Clouded, blurred or dim vision",
      "Increasing difficulty with vision at night",
      "Sensitivity to light and glare",
      "Need for brighter light for reading and other activities",
      "Seeing \"halos\" around lights",
      "Frequent changes in eyeglass or contact lens prescription",
      "Fading or yellowing of colors",
      "Double vision in a single eye"
    ],
    treatment: "Surgery is the only effective treatment for cataracts. The cloudy lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens. The procedure is generally safe and improves vision in most people. Regular eye exams are important for early detection."
